# AI made Programmer

My **Building AI** course Project

## Summary

Type to the AI what to code and it will do it **briefly**

## Background

Can help you **solve your issues programmming**, as i'm beggining i don't have a good idea of the background but i know it could be a cool thing **can type code and help you solve issues** (about coding)
## How is it used?

It could be used as many of the AIs but something different, specially made to code and generate fast solutions in code or type that

Like:

User: Type a loop that prints a variable `num` and breaks when the variable `num` reaches `10` with a cooldown of **one second per number** and `num` is increased after being printed, note that `num` beggins as `0`.

AI:

```
from time import sleep # Import sleep() from time module

num = 0

while num < 10: # Loop until num reaches 10+
    print(num) # Show the value
    num += 1 # Add one to num
    sleep(1) # Cooldown of one second
  
```
If you need more help i will be here to help you coding.

## Data sources and AI methods

It came from me, since i think i could make a **good or better** AI than ChatGPT or anything
So far i haven't used any source or any AI

## Challenges

I'm just beggining on it, so for now there are no challenges

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?

My inspiration comes from Github Copilot by OpenAI and Github  (Which i used on Visual Studio Code) and from ChatGPT from OpenAI
